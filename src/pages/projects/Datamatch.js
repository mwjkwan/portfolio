  matchmaking service. Started at Harvard in 1994, Datamatch is used by over 25,000 students across 17 universities.
  This year, I redesigned the website with a focus on the match interface, integrating a sidebar so users
  can schedule dates and browse their matches without needing to navigate between pages. In addition, I also
  designed our new school and restaurant portals, which allow our partners to edit their survey questions and
  validate date codes automatically.`,
  development: `Besides design, I also contributed to the web team by re-implementing the profile page
  and the restaurant portal summary statistics. Our tech stack uses React, Redux, and Firebase.`,
